I am currently working on using generative models for this and have also used CNNs for medical images in the past. Otherwise I have generic data science / bioinformatics experience. I’m very excited to meet everyone and learn more about what people have worked on! I am open to working on any cool projects and don’t have a specific idea, but I’m also interested in finding ways to utilise findings in literature more efficiently, especially when it comes to deploying other people’s models and benchmarking against them. It would be really cool to easily automate the setup and get initial examples for new computational tools so you don’t have to spend days working out how to get them running. I think this is also an obstacle for modelling experimental plans before starting. Otherwise I’m interested in interpretability and molecular interaction prediction.
